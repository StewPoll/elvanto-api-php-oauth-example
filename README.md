# Elvanto V1 API PHP Oauth Example

This library is intended as a super-simple example of how to direct a user to log into Elvanto and get Oauth Tokens, 
followed by making a super-simple call. 

## Usage
To use this library, first set the following Environment Variables, through whatever methods you desire:
* ELV_CLIENT_ID
* ELV_CLIENT_SECRET

[This Article](https://help.elvanto.com/using-elvanto/billing-accounts/working-with-your-account/how-to-use-the-elvanto-api/)
describes where you can get your Client ID and Secret. Instead of hitting "Get API Key" though use "Add Integration" and
create a custom integration.
